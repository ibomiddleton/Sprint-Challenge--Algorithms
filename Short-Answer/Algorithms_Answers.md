#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime is O(n) which is Linear Time. The runtime increases linearly with the size of the input data.


b) Runtime is 0(2^n) which is Exponential Time. The growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 


c) Runtime is 0(n) which is Linear Time. In this one the size of the input directly correlates with the runtime. Runtime increases linearly with the size of input data.


## Exercise II

    if a < f:
        return True
    else:
        return False

a is number of floors, f is the floor the egg isn't safe to drop from.
If the egg is dropped from a which is less than f then the egg won't break. Anything else will break the egg.

This runtime is 0(1) which is Constant Time.
